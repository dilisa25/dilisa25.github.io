    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p>  I was born in America, but my parents are from Grenada. Growing up, my family wasn’t financially well-off, which pushed me to be resourceful and curious about how things work. I knew I wanted a career that would give me financial freedom. So I became interested in fintech I'm interested in technology and engineering, and I’ve had hands-on experience building and assembling projects, including a custom-built PC. I’ve also explored robotics, cybersecurity, coding, and 3D modeling, always looking for ways to improve my skills and take on new challenges.
