    <h2 >Cooking and Baking </h2>  
    <p> I'm interested in cooking and baking. I got into it during COVID-19 because we couldn't always get food easily, so I started making things from scratch. Over time, I found that I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and techniques.

    <hr class="alive">
    <p>Raspberry Pi projects interest me because they allow me to create functional gadgets using both hardware and software. These projects, such as building a smart mirror, help me learn and experiment with coding and automation while working on something practical and fun. It's a great way to apply my curiosity and skills in tech.
